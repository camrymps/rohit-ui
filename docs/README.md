# Rohit UI Documentation

This folder contains the documentation for the Rohit UI component library, a Windows 98-styled React UI kit with a humorous twist.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main documentation page
- `getting-started.html` - Installation and usage guide
- `themes.html` - Theme documentation and customization
- `/components/` - Individual component documentation
- `/assets/` - CSS, images, and other assets

## Component Documentation

Each component documentation page includes:

1. Import instructions
2. Usage examples with code snippets
3. Props table
4. CSS customization guidance
5. "Rohit Mode" behavior description

## Local Development

To view the documentation locally, simply open any HTML file in your browser.

## Deployment

This documentation is designed to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Notes

The documentation includes a Windows 98-style CSS theme for an authentic retro experience. All examples show both standard usage and the special "Rohit Mode" that adds silly animations and behaviors.
